### About the project:
*This project was built with Expo instead of React Native CLI for a quick start and a total of 2 working days were spent on this project.*

1. The user interface in the Figma file was coded exactly with the values in the Figma file.

 Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/dGwjEPZdMaGJv3z79ljb90/SMUIKitt?node-id=0%3A1&t=9ZVLpMrS2Y2huJFq-1

2. All data in the application is stored in the store with the Redux toolkit

3. Animations are used on the Conversation (Messages) screen, but these animations are simple animations. There are some pages where scroll and focus animations are applicable but no effort was made for detailed animation.

### To run the project on your own computer:
`yarn && yarn expo start`
